main.m is now main.mm

It should become .m again once all C++ code is gone.

This causes the project to use the C++ compiler and be able to use the library
(which contains) C++ and Objective-C++ code.
As the build setting is 'compile sources "by filetype"', no additinal warnings or
errors are introduced in existing files (which could be the case when setting
the build setting to 'compile sources "as ObjectiveC++"').
